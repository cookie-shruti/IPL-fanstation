## <u> How to contribute? </u>

### Step #1. Create a Copy of this Repository
In order to work on an open-source project, you will first need to make your own copy of the repository. To do this, you should fork the repository and then clone it so that you have a local working copy.

> **Fork this repo. Click on the Fork button at the top right corner.**

With the repository forked, the next step is to clone it so as to make a copy of the code base locally on your device.

> **Cloning the Repository**

To make your own local copy of the repository you would like to contribute to, let’s first open up a terminal window.

We’ll use the git clone command along with the URL that points to your fork of the repository.

* Open the Command Prompt
* Type this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/IPL-fanstation
```

### Step #2: Creating a New Branch
It is important to branch the repository so that you are able to manage the workflow, isolate your code, and control what features make it back to the main branch of the project repository.

When creating a branch, it is very important that you create your new branch off of the master branch. 
**To create a new branch, from your terminal window, follow:**


```
git branch your-branch
git checkout your-branch
```
Once you enter the git checkout command, you will receive the following output:

```
Switched to branch 'your-branch'
```


### Step #3: Contribute
Make relevant changes. Add new functionality or fix some bugs. Add documentations. Contribute in any way you feel like ;)

### Step #4: Commiting and Pushing:
Once you have modified an existing file or added a new file to the project, you can add it to your local repository, which we can do with the git add command , commit these added changes and then push these to github. The set of commands for this step are as follows:

 ``` 
 git add .
 git commit -m "commit message"
 git push --set-upstream origin new-branch
 ```
### Step #5: Create Pull Request
At this point, you are ready to make a pull request to the original repository.

You should navigate to your **forked** repository, and press the “Compare & pull request” button on the page.

GitHub will alert you that you are able to merge the two branches because there is no competing code. You should add in a **title**, a **comment**, and then press the **“Create pull request”** button.
